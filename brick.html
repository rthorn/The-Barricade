<div id="brick">
	<b>The Barricade</b>  is a siege defense game inspired by <i>Les Misérables</i>' depiction of the Paris Uprising of 1832. Your goal is to defend the barricade against waves of attacks by the French military until you gain enough <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> for a full-fledged revolution.
	<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
	Waves of French soldiers are attacking your barricade. Your barricade is defended by characters known as Amis and their supplies of <p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p>, <p style="color: darkred">Food</p>, and <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>. To win, you must either purchase the <i>RÉVOLUTION!</i> upgrade for 10,000 <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> or survive 40 Waves and recruit Victor Hugo for 2000 <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>. If any single wall of your barricade falls, it's game over.<br/>
	<br/>
	Each Wave is split into three phases: <p style="color: darkblue">Prepare</p>, <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p>, and <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p>. While enemies will only attack the central Chanvrerie barricade at first, they will eventually begin to attack the smaller Mondétour barricade on the left, and, later, a new Prêcheurs barricade that will need to be built on the right.
	<h3 id="prepare">Prepare</h3>
	<p style="color: darkblue">Prepare</p> for the upcoming battle by placing Amis on the central barricade walls or in the Corinthe building on the left. Amis can shoot the enemy from either location, however, a wall without any Amis protecting it will fall much faster. Once enemies begin attacking the side barricades, you will need to place Amis there are well, while Amis in buildings can attack enemies on either side.<br/>
	<br/>
	Amis on the barricades are directly in the line of fire, but the more Amis on a single wall, the less likely any one Ami is to be targeted. The higher the wall, the more Amis can fit on it. Higher walls will also better shield Amis from enemy fire.
	<h3 id="fight">Fight!</h3>
	The French military appears in the <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p> phase to exchange bullets with your Amis. The Wave's battle is won when the military retreats at the end of the day, or they are wiped out first. You earn increasing <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> every time you survive a battle, and 2x <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> if you defeated all enemies before the day's end. You will lose <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> for any Ami that dies.<br/>
	<br/>
	Amis in buildings cannot move during the battle, but those on the barricade or not currently fighting will be able to move around freely. Both your Amis and enemies will miss more frequently the lower their health is. In addition, your Amis will not be able to shoot if you run out of <p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p>.
	<h3 id="recover">Recover</h3>
	After each battle you have a chance to <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p>. Amis can get ready for the next Wave in many ways: looting ammo and food, building up the barricade, scouting for information, healing their wounds, or just hanging out and drinking.
	<ul role="list">
  	<li>Each Ami <b>looting</b> gains between 5-10 <p style="color: darkred">Food</p> or 50-100 <p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p>.</li>
    <li><p style="color: darkred">Food</p> can be used to <b>feed</b> wounded Amis once each during recovery, giving them back 25 health.</li>
  	<li>Each Ami <b>drinking</b> gains between 5-10 <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>. No one will be able to drink if you run out of <p style="color: darkred">Food</p>.</li>
    <li><b>Building</b> the barricade walls increases their height, staving off their destruction and allowing more Amis to use it as cover.</li>
    <li><b>Scouting</b> will give information of the upcoming attack during the next <p style="color: darkblue">Prepare</p> phase, but has a 20% risk of death. Scouting will give you up to 3 Wave notice of a new barricade being attacked for the first time during the next <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p> phase.</li>
    <li><b>Resting</b> in the Corinthe building will heal 40% of an Ami's health and give a temporary 20% damage boost for being well-rested.</li>
  </ul>
	<p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p>, <p style="color: darkred">Food</p>, and <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> can be used to purchase upgrades, including damage and health buffs and improvements to the barricade and buildings, and to recruit Citizens and other unique Amis to your cause during the <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p> phase.<br/>
	<br/>
	A small Precheurs barricade will be automatically built in the <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p> phase immediately before being attacked from the right for the first time. After the Precheurs barricade is built, your Amis are surrounded and all looting will come with a 20% risk of death, just like scouting.
	<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
	<p style="color: silver">Drag and drop</p> Amis to put them in position, or use the <p style="color: silver">Auto-fill</p> button to place any Amis not yet in position if you're in a hurry.<br/>
	<br/>
	Press the <p style="color: silver">Reset</p> button to reset all placed Amis. Press an individual location's <p style="color: silver">Reset</p> button, which appears on hover, to reset just the Amis located there.<br/>
	<br/>
	<p style="color: silver">Shift-drag</p> a stack of Citizens to drag the entire stack.<br/>
	<br/>
	<p style="color: silver">Ctrl-Shift-drag</p> a stack of Citizens on to an active barricade wall to evenly distribute the Citizens across all active barricade walls.<br/>
	<br/>
	Hold <p style="color: silver">Space</p> during the <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p> phase to increase the speed by 3x. Release <p style="color: silver">Space</p> to go back to normal speed.
	<h2 id="enemies">Enemies</h2>
	<h3 id="enemytypes">Enemy Types</h3>
	New enemy types will appear as you progress through the game.
	<h4 id="soldiers">Soldiers</h4>
	Simple Soldiers will attack from the very beginning. They do a small amount of damage to the barricades and the Amis on them, but are unable to target Amis in buildings.
	<div class="hidden15">
	<h4 id="snipers">Snipers</h4>
	Snipers can shoot any Ami on the barricade in front of them or in adjacent buildings, and do a much larger amount of damage per shot but shoot less frequently. Amis hit by a Sniper will briefly flash yellow as an indicator.
	</div>
	<div class="hidden30">
	<h4 id="cannons">Cannons</h4>
	Cannons will infrequently knock all Amis off a wall of the barricade, doing significant damage to those Amis and leaving the wall unprotected until you replace them.
	</div>
	<h3 id="javert">Javert</h3>
	Javert is a unique enemy who does not attack during the <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p> phase with the other enemies. When recruiting Citizens, it's possible for Javert to sneak in. He will be indistinguishable from other Citizens, but will sabotage any activity he is a part of and will not defend the barricade or be attacked by enemies. He can be dismissed from the barricade, gaining you 500 <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>, but if dismissed, he may return later.
	<h2 id="amis">Amis</h2>
	You start the game with 8 unique, named Amis. As the game continues, you can recruit generic Citizens as well as new unique Amis. Each unique Ami has a special ability that can be upgraded to become more powerful.
	<h3 id="citizens">Citizens</h3>
	Citizens start with much lower health and damage than unique Amis, but all Citizens can be made stronger through upgrades. Individual Citizens can be taught the special abilities of one or more unique Amis after the training upgrade has been purchased. If you train a Citizen that has already been trained in a different ability and has no room for more, the new ability will replace the old one.<br/>
	<br/>
	Identical Citizens will stack in some contexts; see <a href="#controls"><b>Controls</b></a> for some ways to make moving stacks easier.<br/>
	<br/>
	There is a limit to the number of Citizens that can be recruited, which you can increase through upgrades. When recruiting new Citizens, watch out for <a href="#javert"><b>Javert</b></a>.
	<h3 id="uniques">Unique Amis</h3>
	Each unique Ami can be individually upgraded to improve their health, damage, or special ability. Each special ability starts at level 1 and can be upgraded 3 times, up to level 4. Trained Citizens will receive the ability at the same level as the unique Ami at the time of training. If you upgrade the unique Ami again later, you will need to retrain Citizens to get them to the higher level. Citizens cannot train other Citizens, so if a unique Ami dies or is dismissed, it will no longer be possible to train new Citizens in their ability. Unique Amis cannot be trained in the abilities of other Amis.
	<h4 id="enjolras">Enjolras</h4>
	Enjolras regains a certain percentage of lost health at the end of a Wave. This ability cannot increase health above 100%, nor can it revive an Ami from death. Amis healed to full health by this ability <b>do</b> count as being at full health at the end of the Wave for the <i>Missed Me</i> achievement.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>Regains 25% health at end of wave</li>
		<li>Regains 50% health at end of wave</li>
		<li>Regains 75% health at end of wave</li>
		<li>Regains all health at end of wave</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="bahorel">Bahorel</h4>
	Bahorel has a 5% chance of making a critical hit that does extra damage. The extra damage amount is multiplied by the base damage done by the Ami, so higher base damage will increase the power of the critical hit even further.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>5% chance to do 1.5x damage</li>
		<li>5% chance to do 2x damage</li>
		<li>5% chance to do 3x damage</li>
		<li>5% chance to do 5x damage</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="bossuet">Bossuet</h4>
	Bossuet is terribly unlucky and attracts enemy bullets. Enemies are more likely to target him than any other individual Ami, making him and, if he is on a barricade, the wall he is on take more damage. Other Amis and barricade walls take less damage as a result.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>2x as likely to be attacked</li>
		<li>4x as likely to be attacked</li>
		<li>10x as likely to be attacked</li>
		<li>25x as likely to be attacked</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="combeferre">Combeferre</h4>
	Combeferre finds extra <p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p> when looting.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>Finds 1.5x ammo</li>
		<li>Finds 2x ammo</li>
		<li>Finds 3x ammo</li>
		<li>Finds 5x ammo</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="courfeyrac">Courfeyrac</h4>
	When Courfeyrac rests during the <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p> phase, he improves the healing and temporary damage boost all Amis get from resting. If multiple Amis with this ability rest at the same time, their abilities stack. Amis cannot be healed above 100% health, but can receive a temporary damage boost of any amount.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>When resting, all resting gain 5% boost to health and damage</li>
		<li>When resting, all resting gain 10% boost to health and damage</li>
		<li>When resting, all resting gain 15% boost to health and damage</li>
		<li>When resting, all resting gain 20% boost to health and damage</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="feuilly">Feuilly</h4>
	Feuilly does extra build on the barricade walls.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>Does 1.5x build on barricade</li>
		<li>Does 2x build on barricade</li>
		<li>Does 3x build on barricade</li>
		<li>Does 5x build on barricade</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="joly">Joly</h4>
  Joly finds extra <p style="color: darkred">Food</p> when looting.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>Finds 1.5x food</li>
		<li>Finds 2x food</li>
		<li>Finds 3x food</li>
		<li>Finds 5x food</li>
	</ol>
	<h4 id="prouvaire">Prouvaire</h4>
  Prouvaire's heroism in the face of death inspires his fellow Amis. When Prouvaire dies, instead of losing <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>, <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> is gained.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>Boosts hope by 25 at death</li>
		<li>Boosts hope by 50 at death</li>
		<li>Boosts hope by 75 at death</li>
		<li>Boosts hope by 100 at death</li>
	</ol>
	<div class="hidden2">
	<h4 id="grantaire">Grantaire <i>(Wave 2)</i></h4>
  Grantaire excels at being drunk.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>Gains 1.5x hope from drinking</li>
		<li>Gains 2x hope from drinking</li>
		<li>Gains 3x hope from drinking</li>
		<li>Gains 5x hope from drinking</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="hidden6">
	<h4 id="gavroche">Gavroche <i>(Wave 6)</i></h4>
  Gavroche has met <a href="#javert"><b>Javert</b></a> before, and can recognize him if he's nearby. When Gavroche is in the same location as Javert at the end of the <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p> or <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p> phase, he has a chance to recognize him. If he does, Javert will be labeled and no longer stack with normal Citizens.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>When co-located, has 25% chance of identifying Javert</li>
		<li>When co-located, has 50% chance of identifying Javert</li>
		<li>When co-located, has 75% chance of identifying Javert</li>
		<li>When co-located, identifies Javert</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="hidden8">
	<h4 id="mabeuf">Mabeuf <i>(Wave 8)</i></h4>
  If Mabeuf is on a barricade wall at the end of a Wave, you gain extra <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> for beating the Wave. If multiple Amis with this ability are on the barricade at the end of a Wave, their abilities stack.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>If on barricade, gain 5% more hope at wave end</li>
		<li>If on barricade, gain 10% more hope at wave end</li>
		<li>If on barricade, gain 15% more hope at wave end</li>
		<li>If on barricade, gain 20% more hope at wave end</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="hidden10">
	<h4 id="marius">Marius <i>(Wave 10)</i></h4>
  Marius can save the entire barricade even when all seems lost. If he's on the barricade during the <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p> phase, he can end the Wave early by scaring off the enemy. A button will appear below Marius when he is able to end the Wave.<br/>
  <br/>
  Ending a Wave early starts at a cost of 500 <p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p>, and the cost doubles each time Marius' ability is used, so it must be used sparingly. In addition, no <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> is received when this ability is used to end the Wave.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>If on barricade, can spend ammo to end wave 10% early</li>
		<li>If on barricade, can spend ammo to end wave 25% early</li>
		<li>If on barricade, can spend ammo to end wave 50% early</li>
		<li>If on barricade, can spend ammo to end wave 60% early</li>
	</ol>
	</div>
	<div class="hidden12">
	<h4 id="eponine">Éponine <i>(Wave 12)</i></h4>
  When one of your Amis would die, Éponine will throw herself in front of a bullet for them. At level 1, Éponine will die in their stead, but at higher levels she will only lose a flat amount of health. As it is a flat amount and not a percentage, if Éponine's health is upgraded, she will be able to save even more Amis before dying herself.<br/>
  <br/>
  Amis saved by Éponine will be automatically moved out of combat and back to the staging area, even if they were in a building.
	<ol role="list">
		<li>If another ami would die, dies for them instead</li>
		<li>If another ami would die, loses 50 health for them instead</li>

  Cosette is a unique Ami with only a single level of special ability.
