	<b>The Barricade</b>  is a siege defense game inspired by <i>Les Misérables</i>' depiction of the Paris Uprising of 1832. Your goal is to defend the barricade against waves of attacks by the French military until you gain enough <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> for a full-fledged revolution.
	<h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>
	Waves of French soldiers are attacking your barricade. Your barricade is defended by characters known as Amis and their supplies of <p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p>, <p style="color: darkred">Food</p>, and <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>. To win, you must either purchase the <i>RÉVOLUTION!</i> upgrade for 10,000 <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> or survive 40 Waves and recruit Victor Hugo for 2000 <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>. If any single wall of your barricade falls, it's game over.<br/>
	<br/>
	Each Wave is split into three phases: <p style="color: darkblue">Prepare</p>, <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p>, and <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p>. While enemies will only attack the central Chanvrerie barricade at first, they will eventually begin to attack the smaller Mondetour barricade on the left, and even a new Precheurs barricade that will need to be built on the right.
	<h3 id="prepare">Prepare</h3>
	<p style="color: darkblue">Prepare</p> for the upcoming battle by placing Amis on the central barricade walls or in the Corinthe building. Amis can shoot the enemy from either location, however, a wall without any Amis protecting it will fall much faster. Once enemies begin attacking the side barricades, you will need to place Amis there are well, while Amis in buildings can attack enemies on either side.<br/>
	<br/>
	Amis on the barricades are directly in the line of fire, but the more Amis on a single wall, the less damage any one Ami on that wall will take. The higher the wall, the more Amis can fit on it. Higher walls will also better shield Amis from enemy fire.
	<h3 id="fight">Fight!</h3>
	The French military appears in the <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p> phase to exchange bullets with your Amis. You must either survive until the day is over, or kill all of your enemies first. You earn increasing <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> every time you survive a Wave, and 2x <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> if you finish early. You will lose <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> for any Ami that dies.<br/>
	<br/>
	Amis in buildings cannot move during the battle, but those on the barricade or not currently fighting will be able to move around freely. Both your Amis and enemies will miss more frequently the lower their health is. In addition, your Amis will not be able to shoot if you run out of <p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p>.
	<h3 id="recover">Recover</h3>
	After the battle you have a chance to <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p>. Amis can get ready for the upcoming Wave in many ways: looting ammo and food, building up the barricade, scouting for information, healing their wounds, or just hanging out and drinking.
	<ul role="list">
        <li><b>Drinking</b> gains <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>.</li>
        <li><p style="color: darkred">Food</p> can be used to <b>feed</b> Amis once each during recovery, giving them back 25 health. If you are out of <p style="color: darkred">Food</p>, Amis cannot gain <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> from drinking.</li>
        <li><b>Building</b> the barricade walls increases their height, staving off their destruction.</li>
        <li><b>Scouting</b> will give information of the upcoming attack, but has a 20% risk of death. Scouting will give you up to 3 Wave notice of a new barricade being attacked for the first time.</li>
        <li><b>Resting</b> in the Corinthe building will heal 40% of an Ami's health and give a temporary 20% damage boost for being well-rested.</li>
    </ul>
	<p style="color: darkred">Ammo</p>, <p style="color: darkred">Food</p>, and <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p> can also be used to purchase upgrades, including damage and health buffs, improvements to the barricade and buildings, and the ability to recruit Citizens and other unique Amis to your cause during the <p style="color: darkblue">Recover</p> phase.<br/>
	<br/>
	A small Precheurs barricade will be automatically built immediately before being attacked from the right for the first time. After the Precheurs barricade is built, your Amis are surrounded and all looting will come with a 20% risk of death.
	<h2 id="controls">Controls</h2>
	Hold <p style="color: silver">Space</p> during the <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p> phase to increase the speed by 3x. Release <p style="color: silver">Space</p> to go back to normal speed.<br/>
	<br/>
	<p style="color: silver">Shift</p>-drag a stack of Citizens to drag the entire stack.<br/>
	<br/>
	<p style="color: silver">Shift-Ctrl</p>-drag a stack of Citizens on to an active barricade wall to evenly distribute the Citizens across all active barricade walls.<br/>
	<br/>
	<h2 id="enemies">Enemies</h2>
	New enemy types will appear as you progress through the game.
	<h3 id="soldiers">Soldiers</h3>
	Simple Soldiers will attack from the very beginning. They do a small amount of damage to the barricades and the Amis on them, but are unable to target Amis in buildings.
	<h3 id="snipers">Snipers</h3>
	Snipers can shoot any Ami, including those in adjacent buildings, and do a much larger amount of damage per shot but shoot less frequently. Amis hit by a Sniper will briefly flash yellow as an indicator.
	<h3 id="cannons">Cannons</h3>
	Cannons will infrequently knock all Amis off a wall of the barricade, doing significant damage to those Amis and leaving the wall unprotected until you replace them.
	<h3 id="javert">Javert</h3>
	Javert is a unique enemy who does not attack during the <p style="color: darkblue">Fight!</p> phase with the other enemies. When recruiting Citizens, it's possible for Javert to sneak in. He will be indistinguishable from other Citizens, but will sabotage any activity he is a part of and will not defend the barricade or be attacked by enemies. He can be dismissed from the barricade, gaining you 500 <p style="color: darkred">Hope</p>, but if dismissed, he may return later.
	<h2 id="amis">Amis</h2>
	You start the game with 8 unique, named Amis. As the game continues, you can recruit generic Citizens as well as new unique Amis. Each unique Ami has a special ability that can be upgraded to become more powerful.
	<h3 id="citizens">Citizens</h3>
	Citizens start with much lower health and damage than unique Amis, but all Citizens can be made stronger through upgrades. Individual Citizens can be taught the special abilities of one or more unique Amis after the training upgrade has been purchased. Identical citizens will stack in some contexts; see <a href="#controls"><b>Controls</b></a> for some ways to make moving stacks easier.<br/>
	<br/>
	When recruiting new Citizens, watch out for <a href="#javert"><b>Javert</b></a>.
	<h3 id="uniques">Unique Amis</h3>
	Each unique Ami can be individually upgraded to improve their health, damage, or special ability.
	<h4 id="enjolras">Enjolras</h3>
	Enjolras is the leader of the revolution.
